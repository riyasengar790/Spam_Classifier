## Introduction
The Spam Email Classifier project aims to assist in filtering unwanted emails by predicting whether an email is spam or ham. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the classifier can automatically categorize incoming emails, thereby improving email management efficiency and reducing the risk of exposure to malicious content.

## Features
1. Predicts whether an email is spam or ham based on its content.
2. Provides performance evaluation metrics for different classification models.
3. Offers model persistence for seamless integration into production environments.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. Each email is represented by its content and corresponding label.

## Usage
To use the Spam Email Classifier:
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Install the necessary dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
Run the provided Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Utilize the trained model for classifying new email data.

## Model Building
The classifier employs the Naive Bayes algorithm, specifically Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers, for modeling and prediction tasks. The TF-IDF vectorization technique is used to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Evaluation
The performance of each classifier is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, confusion matrices are generated to visualize the classification results.

## Deployment
The trained model can be deployed in various environments, including web applications, email clients, and cloud platforms. Integration with existing email systems can enhance email filtering capabilities and improve overall security.
